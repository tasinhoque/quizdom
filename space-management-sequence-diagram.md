1. Setters will create spaces which will be validated by the system.
2. Setters will add members to the newly created space.
3. Setters will be able to set rules for the members.  
   My interpretation: Setters will have the privilege to ban/mute members.
   If a member is muted, he/she wouldn't be able to participate in any discussion.
   A member can get banned for a specific time period (during which no quizzes will
   be available to that member).
4. Setters will post quizzes on the space.  
   Note: According to Asif, maximum one quiz can be contained by a space. But does
   that make sense?  
   In my opinion, a quiz should have a dedicated management system (keeping track
   of participants, updating leader board, etc) and spaces will have features other
   than those of quizzes.
5. After a quiz finishes, it will be archived.
6. Members will participate in quizzes (the details shouldn't be shown), after
   which, a leader board will be populated.
7. Members will be able to ask questions and post answers in discussion threads of
   the space (let's keep the threads global [as opposed to being related to a quiz],
   each thread having a query [title] and a category).
8. If some member mentions another member in a discussion thread, the second member
   will get a notification (there could be other cases for notification, like
   commenting on the same thread).
